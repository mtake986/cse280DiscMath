# Functions

## 3.1 Encapsulation for Fun and Profit

Answer 107 
The codomain would have to be R + to accommodate
square roots of integers that are irrational numbers.

## 3.2 A Plethora of Terms
“The set of all possible inputs for a function is called its domain.
Distinguish that from the set of all possible outputs for a function, which
is called its codomain. So the domain of our sample function, which does
the four basic arithmetic operations on certain pairs of its inputs, is the
set of numbers, and its codomain is the same set.”

to overload an everyday word, we call the inputs to a function its **arguments**. And a not-so-everyday word — **arity** — means the number of input arguments a function has.


Exercise 107 
What is the codomain of the function whose domain is Z+ and whose output is the square root of its input?


## 3.3 Image and Preimage, Pre-In-Post Fix
“Til said that image refers to the output of a function applied to some input, and the input is called the preimage of the output — so you nailed it.”

The set of all actual outputs is called the range
of the function. 

## 3.8 What’s In A Name?
**lambda** — and its definition is an anonymous, nameless function. For example, compare the named double function with its nameless lambda equivalent 
```python
def double(n):
  return n * 2

lambda n: n * 2

for n in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]:
  print('{0} --> {1:2d}'.format(n, (lambda x: x * 3 + 1 if x % 2 else x // 2) (n)))

```
“True,” said Til. “I would instead urge you to prefer mapping to looping. And I don’t mean the map-as-dictionary mapping representation of a function. I mean the concept of **higher-order** functions, that I mentioned earlier, if you recall. These are functions that take functions as arguments .

```python
def morphifyr(f, l, a):
  if l:
    a.append(f(l[0]))
    morphifyr(f, l[1:], a)
accum = []
morphifyr(lambda x: x ** 2, [1, 2, 3], accum)
print(accum)
```
“The Python map function is very much like your morphifyr,
except that it has no need for an external accumulator."

```python
# Python's built-in function map()
first_3_squares_map = map(lambda x: x ** 2, [1, 2, 3])
print(first_3_squares_map)
print(list(first_3_squares_map))
```

#### Why mapping is powerful
Mapping need not be so conceived! Imagine a computer with many processors capable of executing the same code on different data items, one item preloaded into each processor. Then the mapping over the complete data set can happen in parallel, that is, the function simultaneously transforms each item, rather than sequentially one at a time.11 This is powerful magic!”


Exercise 113 
Define the “take the fractional part of” function fracpart in terms of floor as follows:
```python
from math import floor
def fracpart(number):
return number - floor(number)
```
For example, fracpart(3.14159) is 0.14158999999999988.
Suppose fracpart were the primitive, builtin function. How would
you define floor (assuming it were not builtin) using fracpart?

Answer 113 But the caution in the hint doesn’t matter — after subtracting fracpart(x) from x and calling int to make it an integer, you get the right answer regardless. Try it! 
```python
def myfloor(x):
  return int(x - fracpart(x))
```

Exercise 114
The floor of x is denoted bxc, and the ceiling of x is denoted dxe. Graph these functions f (x) = bxc and c(x) = dxe for real number values of x in the interval from -5.0 to 5.0, inclusive
No Answer

Exercise 115 Which of these statements about floor and ceiling are
correct, for any real number x and any integers n and m?
1,4,5,6,7, 9
Answer 115 The only ones that are incorrect are numbers eight and
ten.


Exercise 118 
Write code in the same fashion as Ila’s in Figure 3.22
to demonstrate the non-commutativity of the composition of two functions of your own choosing.
```python
def f(x):
  return x^3
def g(x):
  return x^2 + 3
def fog(x):
  return f(g(x))
def gof(x):
  return g(f(x))
# when x = 2, fog returns 343, and gof returns 67
```
