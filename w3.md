 

 

A proposition: a sentence that is either true or false, nothing else. 

 

“A proposition about sets: The English Alphabet can be split into the set of vowels and the set of consonants.” 

“A proposition about numbers: The square of a number is always greater than that number. 

 

The second so-called proposition is false, but 

“But remember, it’s still a proposition even if it’s false.” 

 

“We are done for today and you are leaving,” said Til. “That’s an example, by the way, of a compound proposition — two standalone propositions (We are done for today, you are leaving) 

 

Ex.6) Write three propositions and three non-propositions. 

Props 

A stone is solid 

Humans breathe 

Muscle gets bigger by working out and eating well 

Non-Props 

Humans itself fly 

Water is solid 

Air is visible 

 

Ex.7) Put the proposition “x is a member of the set of English alphabet consonants” in symbolic logic terms, using C as the symbol naming the set of consonants. 

C > x 

 

Ex.8) Proposition or not? If so, true or false? “2 + 2 = 4.” 

True 

 

Ex.9) Proposition or not? If so, true or false? “2 + 1 = 4.”

Ex.10) Proposition? True or false? “Toronto is the capital of Germany.” 

False 

 

Ex.11) Proposition? True or false? “Read these questions carefully.” 

? I think True 

 

Ex.12) Proposition? True or false? “x + y + z = q.” 

False because all variables are not sure 

 

EX.13) Proposition? True or false? “What time is it?”

Ex. 14) Proposition? True or false? “2x + 3 = 9.” 

False 

 

Ex.15) Proposition? True or false? “Jump!”

Ex.16) “Weeks are shorter than months.” Is this a simple proposition or a compound proposition 

Simple 

 

Ex.17) Simple or compound? “Days are longer than hours and minutes.” 

Compound 

 

Ex.18) Simple or compound? “Hours are longer than minutes and seconds are shorter than minutes.”  

Compound 

 

Ex.19)  Simple or compound? “People can fly or pigs can sing.”
